# LeetCode Solutions

A collection of my LeetCode problem solutions, organized by problem number and stored in separate files for easy navigation.  
This repository helps me practice algorithms, data structures, and common coding interview patterns.
Averagely, the solutions **beat over 90%** of other solutions on LeetCode.
## 📂 Structure

Each problem lives in its own file under /solutions directory:

## 🧠 Goals

- Build strong foundations in algorithms and data structures  
- Practice writing clean, readable, maintainable code  
- Track progress across different topics  
- Keep a reference library for future  

## 🚀 How to Use

Feel free to browse and learn:

- Search by problem name or number  
- Explore solution approaches  

## 💬 Notes

Some solutions may include:

- Brute-force approach  
- Optimized approach  
- Alternative data structures or patterns  

I may revisit solutions over time to refine or optimize them.

## 📝 Contributing

This is a personal practice repository, but feedback or alternative solutions are welcome through Pull Requests.


## Enjoy Leetcoding! 💻 ✨
